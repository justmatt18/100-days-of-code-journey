# 100 Days of Code - log
  Day 0: December 7, 2019

  **Progress:** Dynamically add an embedded youtube video by getting the url and extract the ID. Thanks to vue-youtube-embed dependency. 

  **Thoughts:** I've been working on Vue lately to familiarize and get a hands-on experience with Vue. I found an API about recipes around the world and tried to make them work with Vue. Then, I really struggle on how I should create my own function to extract the ID from a youtube url and add it to an ```<iframe>```, ```src``` property. I never use and learn regex yet. But, I found some dependency about vue-youtube-embed and it's easy to use. I integrate it my project. 

  Day 1: December 8, 2019

  **Progress** Added some grid design to my home page to add more content and improve overall functionality.

  **Thoughts:** I just realize that I'm spending much time on CSS than on my functionality, maybe I need to explore my CSS skills especially ```clip-path``` and ```transform```.

  Day 2: December 9, 2019

  **Progress:** Redesign my Home, Category and About Page. Remove previous full page design to a transparent image background with a transparent background color.

  **Thoughts:** It's really helpful to have some website ideas coming from other famous or well-known sites, to get design inspirations. Also to help myself improve in designing a webpage. 

  Day 3: December 10, 2019

  **Progress:** Working on Wordpress now and it's been awhile when I had worked and opened its files. Removing some white spaces on a svelte component on it. 

  **Thoughts:** I little bit confused about it because it has a svelte component on a wordpress site. And I needed to check its file and see the css on it.


  Day 4: December 11, 2019

  **Progress:** Got a little detour. I learn a little bit about digital ocean and how to access it using ssh locally. Checking of packages and security issues and even checking system status. Will focus on front-end  stuff tomorrow. 

  **Thoughts:** Thought about importance of checking security issues on a server maybe atleast twice a week. Also if there is security problems and updates needed. Checking memory capacity if needs an upgrade. 

  Day 5: December 12, 2019 

  **Progress:** Exploring Vuetify and I love how easy the docs are. Made a UI to try it out. I guess I'll be switching from bootstrap-vue to vuetify ðŸ˜‰. 

  **Thoughts:** I think vuetify has similarities in quasar because of its ability to create material design components. After finishing my ongoing project, I'll be switching to vuetify.
