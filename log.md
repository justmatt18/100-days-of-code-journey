  **Progress:** Dynamically add an embedded youtube video by getting the url and extract the ID. Thanks to vue-youtube-embed dependency. 

  **Thoughts:** I've been working on Vue lately to familiarize and get a hands-on experience with Vue. I found an API about recipes around the world and tried to make them work with Vue. Then, I really struggle on how I should create my own function to extract the ID from a youtube url and add it to an ```<iframe>```, ```src``` property. I never use and learn regex yet. But, I found some dependency about vue-youtube-embed and it's easy to use. I integrate it my project. 

  Day 1: December 8, 2019

  **Progress** Added some grid design to my home page to add more content and improve overall functionality.

  **Thoughts:** I just realize that I'm spending much time on CSS than on my functionality, maybe I need to explore my CSS skills especially ```clip-path``` and ```transform```.

  Day 2: December 9, 2019

  **Progress:** Redesign my Home, Category and About Page. Remove previous full page design to a transparent image background with a transparent background color.

  **Thoughts:** It's really helpful to have some website ideas coming from other famous or well-known sites, to get design inspirations. Also to help myself improve in designing a webpage.
