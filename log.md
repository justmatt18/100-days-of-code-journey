  **Progress:** Just dynamical embed a youtube video by getting the url and extract the ID. Thanks to vue-youtube-embed dependency. 

  **Thoughts:** I've been working on Vue lately to familiarize and get a hands-on experience with Vue. I found an API about recipes around the world and tried to make them work with Vue. Then, I really struggle on how I should create my own function to extract the ID from a youtube url and add it to an ```<iframe>```, ```src``` property. I never use and learn regex yet. But, I found some dependency about vue-youtube-embed and it's easy to use. I integrate it my project.
